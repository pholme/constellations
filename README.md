# constellations
Adjacency lists of Pablo Picasso's constellation drawings from 1924. Handcoded by me in 2018.

The sources are pictures here and there online. For example (here)[https://www.vaultofculture.com/vault/nst/2022/04/29/constellations] (and more links on that page). The letter of the file name corresponds to the page of the notebook (visible in some of the figures).

I can't find the printouts I used for the encoding (showing which node has what number). I'll add them when I find them. So, for now, these files are in an "it is what it is" state. Some are probably accurate, but there are definitely bugs in others. Hopefully, someone more image-analysis savvy can make a better and more automated job.
